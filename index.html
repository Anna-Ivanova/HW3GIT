        The Odesa National Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet (Ukrainian: Одеський національний академічний театр опери та балету) is 
        the oldest theatre in Odesa, Ukraine. The Theatre and the Potemkin Stairs are the most famous edifices in Odesa. The first opera 
        house was opened in 1810 and destroyed by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by Fellner & Helmer in neo-baroque 
        (Vienna Baroque) style and opened in 1887. The architecture of the luxurious audience hall follows the late French rococo style. 
        The unique acoustics of the horseshoe-designed hall allows performers to deliver even a whisper-low tone of voice from the stage 
        to any part of the hall. The most recent renovation of the theatre was completed in 2007.

        Odesa's first theatre (called the City Theatre) was built on the location of the current Odesa Opera and Ballet Theatre and opened 
        on 10 February 1810. The original design, created by the Italian architect Francesco Frapolli, was later modified by the French architect 
        Jean-Francois Thomas de Thomon who also designed St. Petersburg's Old Stock Exchange.[2][3] The main entrance with its colonnade faced the sea.
